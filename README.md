Experimental TidyTuesday
================

This repo will host the code and figures from students of the
experimental biology course at EAFIT university, who are exploring
a [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) dataset
as a course activity. Each student will inquire the selected dataset,
and with [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) tools will aim to solve
its question.

This activity aims to get the students to familiarize with git, github
and tidyverse tools, having a question as a central axis.
